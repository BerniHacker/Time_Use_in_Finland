# Time_Use_in_Finland

A Data Cleansing and Visualization Project in Python.

This project consists in formulating a set of research questions and then searching and importing two data sets from Internet that could help to answer those questions.

The data sets are cleansed and manipulated by using Pandas library.

Then, some exploratory data analysis is performed and plots are created by using Matplotlib library. When creating those plots, graphical heuristics like Edward Tufte data-ink ratio and Alberto Cairo's principles are followed in order to produce visualizations that are truthful, functional, insightful and pleasant to the eye.

The data manipulation process is done by Python programming as much as possible.
